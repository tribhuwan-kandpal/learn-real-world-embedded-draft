# Real World Embedded: Learn Without Prior Experience (Hinglish Guide)

Welcome! I’m Tribhuwan Kandpal—after 20+ years working worldwide in embedded systems, multimedia, protocols, and mentoring engineers, I saw something in China that inspired me:  
There, technical books are written in the local language, focused on real-world practical skills, and made accessible for everyone. That’s a big reason why so many learn and succeed.

This guide is my effort to bring the same spirit to India, in Hinglish.  
No engineering degree needed—just curiosity.

## What’s Inside?

- **Absolute beginner friendly:** Start from zero—no prior experience required.
- **Practical approach:** Every concept is linked to real-world embedded projects.
- **Simple Hinglish:** Explained in plain, everyday language.

## Who is this for?

- Students, hobbyists, career-switchers—anyone curious about how embedded systems work.

Let’s make embedded systems easy and real, together!

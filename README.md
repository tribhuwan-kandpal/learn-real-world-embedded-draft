# Real World Embedded: Learn Without Prior Experience (Hinglish Guide)

Welcome! I’m Tribhuwan Kandpal—after 20+ years working worldwide in embedded systems, multimedia, protocols and mentoring engineers. I saw something in China that inspired me:
There, technical books are written in the local language, focused on real-world practical skills and made accessible for everyone. This approach helps so many people learn and succeed.
This guide is my effort to bring the same spirit to India, in Hinglish, so we can explain complex topics without getting lost in difficult translations.
No engineering degree needed—just curiosity.

### What’s Inside?
- **Absolute beginner friendly:** Start from zero—no prior experience required.
- **Practical approach:** Every concept is linked to real-world embedded projects.
- **Simple Hinglish:** Explained in plain, mostly everyday language.

### Who is this for?
Students, hobbyists, career-switchers—anyone curious about how embedded systems work.
Let’s make embedded systems easy and real, together!
